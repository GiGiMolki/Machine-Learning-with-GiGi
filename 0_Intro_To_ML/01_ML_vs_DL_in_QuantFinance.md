## 1. Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subfield of artificial intelligence focused on developing algorithms that allow systems to learn patterns from data without explicit programming.

### General Illustration in Data Science
In a traditional data science pipeline:
- ML is used to model customer churn, credit scoring, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and demand forecasting.
- You typically:
  - Clean and preprocess data
  - Engineer features based on domain knowledge
  - Train models like decision trees, logistic regression, random forests, or XGBoost
  - Evaluate performance on unseen data

### Key Traits:
- Emphasizes **feature engineering**
- Works well with **structured/tabular data**
- Often used when **interpretability** and **low compute cost** are key

## 2. Introduction to Deep Learning (DL)

**Deep Learning (DL)** is a specialized branch of ML using **multi-layered neural networks** capable of learning both representations and decision boundaries from raw data.

### General Illustration in Data Science
In modern AI systems:
- DL powers image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.
- You feed raw data (e.g., pixels, audio waves, text tokens) directly into neural networks such as CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers.
- The network discovers hierarchical features and learns the task end-to-end.

### Key Traits:
- Excels with **unstructured data** (images, text, audio)
- Minimal manual feature engineering required
- Scales with data and compute

## 4. Types of Machine Learning

### 1. **Supervised Learning**
- Labeled data is used to train predictive models.
- Examples: Classification (fraud detection), Regression (price prediction)

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
- No labels; discovers hidden patterns or structures.
- Examples: Clustering (market segmentation), Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

### 3. **Semi-Supervised Learning**
- A small amount of labeled data + large unlabeled set.
- Example: Customer review classification with few labeled reviews

### 4. **Reinforcement Learning**
- Agents learn by interacting with an environment to maximize reward.
- Example: Portfolio optimization, execution strategies in trading

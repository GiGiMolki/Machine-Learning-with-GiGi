# Types of Machine Learning 

> Focus: Systematic classification of ML types from multiple practical dimensions, followed by engineering challenges and robust design patterns to address them.

## 1. Overview

Machine Learning is not a monolithic concept — it's a vast field with multiple learning paradigms, strategies, and deployment approaches. As engineers, especially those working in real-time systems like High-Frequency Trading (HFT), it's crucial to categorize ML not just academically, but by how it integrates into production pipelines, handles data streams, and adapts to changing environments.

We classify ML systems through different lenses:

- **Supervision**: Whether labels are available during training (Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-supervised, Reinforcement Learning)
- **Learning Strategy**: Whether learning is instance-based or model-based
- **Training Timeline**: Whether models learn in batch (offline) or adapt continuously (online)
- **Functionality**: Predictive vs. Descriptive vs. Generative tasks
- **Deployment Context**: Latency sensitivity, data volatility, and model retrainability

In the context of **Quant Finance and HFT**, choosing the right ML paradigm affects everything from prediction latency to strategy adaptability, compute resource allocation, and explainability to regulators.

This section explores each type of ML across these dimensions, highlights engineering challenges, and proposes practical patterns to build robust ML systems at scale.

>  💡 *Engineer’s Lens*: Think of this as a blueprint to architect ML systems that don’t just work in Jupyter notebooks, but in real-world, latency-bound, mission-critical environments like algorithmic trading engines.

## 2. Based on Supervision

The most fundamental classification of Machine Learning algorithms is based on the presence or absence of **supervision** — that is, whether the training data contains labeled outputs.

### 2.1 Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a dataset that includes input-output pairs. The goal is to learn a mapping function `f(x) = y` that can predict the output for new inputs.

- **Use Cases**: Stock price prediction, fraud detection, credit scoring
- **Common Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Random Forests, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks
- **Characteristics**:
  - Requires large amounts of labeled data
  - Optimized using loss functions (e.g., MSE, Cross-Entropy)
  - Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, AUC, etc.

> 💡 *Engineer’s Lens*: Supervised learning works well in domains with historical market data where ground truth exists (e.g., stock prices or executed trade outcomes). In HFT, it’s used for signal generation and short-term trend prediction.


<img src="/0_Intro_To_ML/Images/image12.png" alt="Supervised Learning Flow - Napkin Diagram" />

<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> This napkin diagram illustrates the flow of supervised learning. It starts with labeled training data (input features and known outputs), which is passed into a model. The model generates predictions, which are compared against actual labels using a loss function. The model parameters are updated via optimization, forming a feedback loop. This setup is foundational for predictive tasks such as market signal forecasting in quant finance.</p>

---

### 2.2 Unsupervised Learning

Here, the dataset contains inputs but no labeled outputs. The objective is to uncover hidden patterns or structures within the data.

- **Use Cases**: Market regime detection, anomaly detection, customer segmentation
- **Common Algorithms**: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, PCA
- **Characteristics**:
  - Works without labeled data
  - Often exploratory and hard to evaluate
  - Focuses on structure, similarity, and density

> 💡 *Engineer’s Lens*: In trading systems, unsupervised learning can cluster correlated assets or detect unusual order book behavior without needing predefined labels.

<img src="/0_Intro_To_ML/Images/image13.png" alt="Unsupervised Learning Flow - Napkin Diagram" />

<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> This napkin diagram represents unsupervised learning where the algorithm receives unlabeled input data and attempts to discover hidden patterns. The diagram includes typical unsupervised tasks like clustering and dimensionality reduction. This approach is vital in quant finance for detecting market regimes, identifying anomalies in trading behavior, and clustering similar financial instruments without labeled outcomes.</p>

---

### 2.3 Semi-Supervised Learning

This is a hybrid approach that uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. It’s especially useful when labels are expensive or time-consuming to obtain.

- **Use Cases**: Sentiment classification with few labeled texts, predictive modeling on sparse financial datasets
- **Common Techniques**: Label propagation, self-training, consistency regularization (e.g., FixMatch)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Balances cost-efficiency and accuracy
  - Often bootstraps from initial supervised signals
  - Assumes structure in unlabeled data can improve generalization

> 💡 *Engineer’s Lens*: In finance, this is valuable when limited annotated data (e.g., labeled news sentiment) can be expanded with large-scale unlabeled data (news headlines, Twitter feeds, etc.).

<img src="/0_Intro_To_ML/Images/image14.png" alt="Semi-Supervised Learning Flow - Napkin Diagram" />

<p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> This napkin diagram illustrates Semi-Supervised Learning, where both a small labeled dataset and a large unlabeled dataset are used for model training. The diagram emphasizes how unlabeled data can enhance learning, helping the model generalize better with less labeled data. Semi-Supervised Learning is valuable in quant finance when acquiring labeled data (e.g., for sentiment analysis or trade classification) is expensive or scarce, while unlabeled data (e.g., market data) is abundant.</p>

---

### 2.4 Reinforcement Learning

In RL, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

- **Use Cases**: Optimal trade execution, portfolio optimization, market-making strategies
- **Core Concepts**: States, actions, rewards, policy, environment
- **Common Algorithms**: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient, PPO
- **Characteristics**:
  - No explicit dataset — learning happens via interaction
  - Focuses on sequential decision-making
  - Often requires simulation environments or live systems

> 💡 *Engineer’s Lens*: RL is particularly suited for real-time trading agents that must learn and adapt under uncertainty, latency constraints, and adversarial conditions.

<img src="/0_Intro_To_ML/Images/image15.png" alt="Reinforcement Learning Flow - Napkin Diagram" />
<p><strong>Figure 5:</strong> This napkin diagram represents Reinforcement Learning (RL), where an agent interacts with an environment and learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties. The agent aims to improve its policy over time to maximize cumulative rewards. RL is a powerful technique in Quant Finance, often used for tasks like portfolio optimization, algorithmic trading, and optimal execution in HFT, where decisions are sequential and must adapt in real-time based on market feedback.</p>

It includes a comparison of Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Semi-Supervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning, with a summary table that highlights key distinctions in data requirements, training methods, and real-world applications. This table is especially useful for selecting the right approach for various tasks in Quant Finance and High-Frequency Trading, where trade-offs between data availability, latency, and real-time decision-making are critical.</p>


## 3. Based on Learning Strategy

This classification is based on *how* learning is conducted — particularly how the model uses the data, stores experience, and generalizes to new inputs. The two main strategies are:

---

### 3.1 Instance-Based Learning

Instance-Based Learning algorithms **memorize training data** and generalize only when they see new examples. No explicit training phase happens — instead, computation is deferred until prediction time (lazy learners).

- **How it works**: Store all examples, compare new input with stored examples using similarity/distance metric (like Euclidean distance).
- **Algorithms**: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Case-Based Reasoning
- **Characteristics**:
  - Fast to train, slow to predict
  - Highly interpretable
  - No model abstraction — purely data-driven
- **Challenges**: Scalability, sensitivity to noise, curse of dimensionality

> 💡 *Engineer’s Lens*: Great when model transparency and simplicity are more important than performance — not commonly used in HFT where latency is critical.

<img src="/0_Intro_To_ML/Images/image17.png" alt="Instance-Based Learning - Napkin Diagram" />

<p><strong>Figure 7:</strong> This napkin diagram illustrates Instance-Based Learning, where the model memorizes the entire dataset and defers generalization to inference time. A new input is compared to stored instances using a distance metric, and the most similar instances guide the prediction. Algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) are classic examples. While interpretable and simple, this approach can become inefficient for large datasets and is less suited for low-latency environments like HFT.</p>

---

### 3.2 Model-Based Learning

Model-Based Learning algorithms **build a model of the data** during training. This model is used to make predictions efficiently during inference time. These are also known as eager learners.

- **How it works**: Train a model `f(x)` using optimization techniques to minimize error on training data.
- **Algorithms**: Linear/Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Neural Networks
- **Characteristics**:
  - Training can be costly
  - Prediction is fast
  - Supports generalization to unseen data
- **Challenges**: Overfitting, requires hyperparameter tuning, assumptions about data

> 💡 *Engineer’s Lens*: Critical in production environments like HFT where fast inference and generalization are mandatory. Most quant ML models fall in this category.


<img src="/0_Intro_To_ML/Images/image18.png" alt="Model-Based Learning - Napkin Diagram" />

<p><strong>Figure 8:</strong> This napkin diagram illustrates Model-Based Learning, where the model is trained in advance using an optimization process. The model generalizes patterns from the data and can quickly make predictions for unseen inputs. This eager learning approach is ideal for production-grade ML systems — especially in domains like HFT, where fast inference and robust generalization are critical for real-time decision-making under uncertainty.</p>

---

> 📌 **Summary Table**

| Strategy            | Description                              | Training Phase | Inference Time | Common Use Cases              |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Instance-Based      | Stores data, predicts via similarity     | None (Lazy)    | Slow           | Memory-based search, fallback |
| Model-Based         | Learns abstract model from data          | Heavy (Eager)  | Fast           | Most supervised ML tasks      |


<img src="/0_Intro_To_ML/Images/image19.png" alt="Instance-Based vs. Model-Based Learning - Napkin Diagram" />

<p><strong>Figure 9:</strong> This napkin diagram compares Instance-Based and Model-Based Learning approaches. On the left, instance-based models like k-NN store all training data and make predictions by comparing new inputs to past examples — a lazy approach that requires no training phase. On the right, model-based learning involves building a predictive function during training, enabling fast and generalized inference. This contrast is crucial when considering latency, memory, and scalability — especially in real-time ML applications like high-frequency trading systems.</p>


## 4. Based on Production Mode

This classification focuses on **how the model receives and processes data over time**, especially in production environments. It's particularly critical in systems where **data streams**, **low latency**, and **continuous learning** matter — like real-time analytics, recommendation engines, or high-frequency trading systems.

---

### 4.1 Online Learning

Online Learning algorithms update the model **incrementally** as each new data point arrives. Ideal for non-stationary environments or where real-time decision-making is essential.

- **How it works**: Model is updated after every data point or mini-batch.
- **Algorithms**: Stochastic Gradient Descent, Passive-Aggressive, Online Perceptron
- **Characteristics**:
  - Fast, memory-efficient
  - Adapts to new data instantly
  - Robust to concept drift (changes in data distribution)
- **Use Cases**: High-Frequency Trading, Fraud Detection, Real-time Recommendations

> ⚙️ *Engineering Note*: Online models are essential in HFT where millisecond-level adaptation to market data is critical.

<img src="/0_Intro_To_ML/Images/image20.png" alt="Online Learning - Napkin Diagram" />

<p><strong>Figure 10:</strong> This napkin diagram represents Online Learning, where models continuously update with each new data point. It’s essential in non-stationary, low-latency environments like high-frequency trading. As data flows in real time — such as tick-by-tick market data — the model adapts immediately without retraining on the full dataset. This enables highly responsive decision-making, making it a foundational method for streaming AI systems.</p>

---

### 4.2 Offline (Batch) Learning

Offline Learning (also called Batch Learning) requires the **entire dataset beforehand** to train the model. Once trained, the model does not learn from new data until retrained.

- **How it works**: Data is processed in bulk, model is trained all at once.
- **Algorithms**: Linear Regression, SVM, Decision Trees (standard implementations)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Stable, robust training
  - Needs full data access
  - Retraining is computationally expensive
- **Use Cases**: Risk Modeling, Portfolio Optimization, Static Forecasting

> ⚙️ *Engineering Note*: Offline learning is appropriate when model stability is more important than adaptivity — such as in quarterly portfolio rebalancing or long-horizon backtests.

<img src="/0_Intro_To_ML/Images/image21.png" alt="Offline (Batch) Learning - Napkin Diagram" />

<p><strong>Figure 11:</strong> This napkin diagram illustrates Offline (Batch) Learning, where models are trained on complete historical datasets in one go. The model is fixed post-training and cannot adapt until explicitly retrained with new data. This approach is widely used in stable systems like risk analysis and portfolio optimization, where consistent behavior is preferred over adaptability. Unlike online learning, it suits environments with infrequent data updates and low tolerance for model volatility.</p>

<p>Generative models learn the joint probability distribution P(X, Y) or just P(X), allowing them to generate new data instances. They model how data is generated, making them suitable for tasks like text generation, image synthesis, and data augmentation. Examples: Naive Bayes, GANs, VAEs, GPT.</p>

<h3>5.4 Discriminative</h3>
<p>Discriminative models learn the conditional probability P(Y | X) or a direct decision boundary between classes. They are optimized for classification accuracy and are often more efficient in making predictions. Examples: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, BERT (for classification).</p>

  6. Engineering Challenges in ML System Design
</h2>

<img src="/0_Intro_To_ML/Images/image22.png" alt="Challenges" />

Designing machine learning systems goes far beyond choosing the right algorithm or tuning hyperparameters. In real-world production environments — especially in latency-sensitive, mission-critical fields like high-frequency trading — engineers face numerous challenges that stem from data quality, model reliability, and system performance. These challenges often require robust, scalable engineering solutions and thoughtful trade-offs.



---

### 6.1 Data Challenges

Real-world data is rarely clean, complete, or well-distributed. Engineers must address multiple data-related issues before models can be trained and deployed effectively.

- **Imbalanced Classes:** In domains like fraud detection or rare-event forecasting, one class can dominate, making models biased and less sensitive to minority classes.
- **Noisy Data:** Financial markets, sensor logs, and scraped web data often contain inconsistencies, outliers, and errors that degrade learning performance.
- **Missing Values:** Incomplete data pipelines or inconsistent logging can lead to nulls, which must be imputed, dropped, or modeled explicitly.
- **Small Labeled Dataset:** Supervised learning struggles when labeled data is scarce or expensive — common in proprietary financial systems or medical diagnostics.
- **Non-Stationarity in Live Systems:** Data distributions in production can drift over time (concept drift), particularly in HFT where markets evolve rapidly.

---

### 6.2 Model Challenges

Even with perfect data, model design and behavior can introduce complex obstacles:

- **Overfitting vs Underfitting:** Striking the right model complexity is essential — too simple, and the model generalizes poorly; too complex, and it memorizes noise.
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff:** Engineers must balance underfitting (bias) and overfitting (variance) while optimizing generalization performance.
- **Interpretability:** In regulated industries or mission-critical use cases, explainable AI is crucial — models must be auditable and transparent.
- **Deployment Speed:** High-frequency environments demand models that can be trained, validated, and deployed quickly, sometimes in near real-time.

---

### 6.3 System Challenges

Scalability, latency, and robustness are key system-level concerns when putting ML models into production pipelines.

- **Scalability:** As data size grows, engineers must optimize memory, compute, and storage across CPUs, GPUs, or distributed clusters.
- **Latency (esp. in real-time HFT):** In high-frequency trading, models must operate in microseconds. Every layer of abstraction — from data loading to prediction — impacts latency.
- **Continuous Learning:** Static models quickly become obsolete in dynamic environments. Engineers need pipelines for real-time model retraining or online learning.
- **Model Monitoring + Drift Detection:** Once deployed, models must be monitored for performance decay. Detecting data drift and concept drift is crucial for long-term reliability.

---


## 7. Robust Engineering Approaches to ML Challenges

When building resilient ML systems, it's important to apply structured approaches to ensure stability, adaptability, and scalability. Below are actionable patterns for overcoming common ML challenges at various levels:

### 🔧 Data-Level Fixes:
• **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create artificial data to supplement small datasets, especially in cases of rare events or imbalanced data, ensuring that the model can generalize better without overfitting to the minority class.

• **Augmentation (esp. in Deep Learning)**: Use transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping to artificially increase the diversity of your training set. This is particularly useful in tasks like image classification to improve robustness.

• **Feature Selection / Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduce the number of features to the most relevant ones, which can improve model performance by removing noise and reducing the chance of overfitting. Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can be applied for dimensionality reduction.

• **Active Learning for Semi-Supervised Tasks**: Identify which data points are the most informative for labeling and focus resources on them. This approach improves model accuracy without the need for a large fully-labeled dataset.

### 🧠 Model-Level Fixes:
• **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models to create a stronger overall model. Techniques like Bagging (e.g., Random Forest) and Boosting (e.g., Gradient Boosting) improve accuracy by mitigating bias and variance.

• **Regularization (L1, L2)**: Add penalties to the loss function to avoid overfitting by discouraging overly complex models. L1 regularization (Lasso) helps in feature selection, while L2 regularization (Ridge) shrinks the coefficients and prevents large values.

• **Early Stopping**: Halt the training process early if the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade. This prevents overfitting, especially when training deep learning models.

• **Cross-validation Strategies**: Use k-fold or stratified cross-validation to ensure that the model is evaluated on different subsets of the data, increasing robustness and generalization capabilities.

### 🏗️ System-Level Fixes:
• **Online Learning Pipelines (e.g., Vowpal Wabbit)**: Implement systems that continuously update the model as new data arrives. Online learning is crucial for adapting to real-time data streams and non-stationary environments like financial markets.

• **Monitoring + Logging + Metrics Tracking**: Regularly track model performance through real-time metrics, logs, and visualizations to detect issues early and identify any drop in performance (e.g., model drift, data distribution shifts).

• **Drift Detection with Statistical Tests**: Use statistical tests like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or D-statistics to detect when the input data distribution has shifted, which may require retraining or adjustments to the model.

• **Model Versioning and Rollback**: Keep track of all model versions and their respective performances. Implement a rollback strategy so that the system can revert to a previous version if a new model causes issues or underperforms.

These engineering practices ensure that your ML models stay robust, reliable, and adaptable, even when faced with real-world challenges such as data changes, model performance degradation, or system failures.
